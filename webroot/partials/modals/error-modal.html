	<p>Sorry about this, there seems to have been a problem. You may have lost connection, or your session may have timed out. It could also be caused by having multiple instances of this attempt open at once. Please check your internet connection, ensure you don't have this attempt open in multiple tabs, and then try refreshing the page. </p>
	<p>Unfortunately, this means that your most recent actions/inputs may be lost. This may include any unchecked questions, uncollected samples or assays that you haven't yet carried out. Reports are automatically saved every minute, but you may lose any text you have entered since the last save. Apologies for any inconvenience or annoyance this causes.</p>
