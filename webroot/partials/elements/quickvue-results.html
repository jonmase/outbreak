<h6>Methods</h6>
<p>QuickVue Influenza A+B Test, 10 minute assay for presence of viral antigens.<br />
Sensitivity for Naso-pharyngeal swabs: Influenza A = 83%, B = 62%.<br />
Specificity for Naso-pharyngeal swabs: Influenza A = 89%, B = 98%.</p>

<h6>Results</h6>
<ul>
<li>All three samples gave a positive result (red band) for Influenza A</li>
<li>All three samples gave a negative result (no band) for Influenza B</li>
<li>All three assays gave a good negative control band (blue band) so the assay worked.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Conclusions</h6>
<p>All three children were suffering from an acute infection that the QuickVue assay indicated was caused by Influenza A. Follow up should involve uncovering whether this infection is of a seasonal variety or something more concerning (e.g. bird flu).</p>
