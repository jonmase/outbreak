	<p>Hiya,</p>
	<p>Just thought I would let you know that I have 
	<span ng-if="swabs === 'all'">already tested those swab samples you collected from the kids in Tovington</span>
	<span ng-if="swabs === 'some'">gone back and collected the remaining swab samples from the kids in Tovington and tested them</span>
	<span ng-if="swabs === 'none'">gone back and collected the swab samples from the kids in Tovington and tested them</span>
	using the QuickVue antigen assay. See below for a brief report that I have sent to the boss so he knows how hard I have been working. I have also attached a PDF of the protocol just in case you are interested in how it works.</p>
	<p>Ta-ta for now,</p>
	<p>Pete</p>
